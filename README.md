# recursive-number-conversion
Write Recursive Functions to Perform the following tasks:
a. Convert integer to Binary.
Hint: With the help question 5 as a helper function you can convert the number into
binary
Function Prototype: int toBinary(int num, int extra);
b. Convery integer to Hexadecimal. (You can use string for this part ONLY)
Function Prototype: string toHexa(int num, int extra);
c. Convert integer to Octal.
Function Prototype: int toOctal(int num, int extra);
The parameter extra is for your help. It has a default value assigned to it. You can change the
default value of the parameter, however, DO NOT CHANGE any other part of the function
prototype.
